# AFS 505 Unit 3 Project

This project utilizes a nextflow pipeline and the NCBI similarity tool BLAST to generate a simple text file from any given FASTA file that lists the number of gene sequences in descending order. 

## Get Started 
You will need to install Nextflow and Blast. Java 8 or later is also required to run the pipeline.

## Tools
* [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/)
* [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi?PAGE_TYPE=BlastDocs&DOC_TYPE=Download)
